With a solid foundation in State management such as Redux, Xstate, along with advanced use of libraries such as rxjs I have the tools at hand to become a lead developer that ease the work of a team of designers and engineers with a clean architecture that provides a robust codebase that is flexible and easy to scale, with an innovative vision about version control, agile methodology, and design thinking, I seek to become part of a multidisciplinary team with challenging goals.

Furthermore, is important to mention that I have a financial background and did work as an accountant for more than 3 years. After that did work as an entrepreneur always keeping up to date with blockchain technologies I started to learn to code about 5 years ago, do work currently in a start-up in berlin that also wants to implement blockchain, I focus on Ethereum writing smart contracts in solidity, but building up skills every day to become a rust developer and build next-generation Dapps.Will like to contribute to React projects for web3.0. While getting involved in blockchain projects that hold the spirit of openness and accessibility for everyone, in Europe most endeavor seems to use Blockchain to perpetuate the same financial discrimination and elitism. I seek to become part of projects that help those who have been always excluded from the financial system, to find a way to be in control of their wealth as finding means to make it grow.
